Telling the story of a young coal miner who strikes a magic meteor, the sparks of which leave him with “lasers for eyes,” Lazer Eyes follows his journey as he becomes a hero, defending the world against the savvy media-mastermind Reflektor, who is bent on enslaving the world one digital screen at a time.
